# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here. This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## v2.1.0 — 2026-06-11

### Added

- `--out` extension now selects the output format when no `--html`/`--pdf` flag
  is given: `md2doc foo.md --out report.pdf` renders a PDF instead of erroring.
  Explicit flags still win, and a flag that contradicts the `--out` extension
  still exits 2. Directory targets (trailing `/` or an existing directory —
  even one named like `foo.pdf`) keep the HTML default.

### Fixed

- Uppercase `.PDF` output paths no longer lose the rendered file. The temp-HTML
  path was derived with a case-sensitive `.pdf` replace, so for `--out X.PDF`
  the temp file aliased the destination and the post-render cleanup deleted the
  freshly written PDF while still reporting success.

### Changed

- Failure modes shifted for two previously rejected invocations: flag-less
  `--out *.pdf` now succeeds (and overwrites an existing file, as explicit
  `--pdf` always did), and in environments without puppeteer it now fails at
  render time with exit 1 instead of failing argument validation with exit 2.
- The mismatch / ambiguous-`--out` error messages now mention the inference
  rule, and the both-formats message now suggests `--out <dir>/` (key
  substrings unchanged in all three).
- An `--out` whose basename is just `.html`/`.pdf` (extension only, no stem) is
  now rejected as ambiguous at argument time instead of failing late in the
  renderer with a contradictory message.

## v2.0.1 — 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- Long snake_case identifiers in headings (h1–h6) and `<dt>`/`<dd>` no longer
  overflow the viewport. The prose-only `overflow-wrap` rule introduced in
  v1.1.0 left headings uncovered; this extends it to headings and definition
  lists while preserving the table-cell `overflow-wrap: normal` override.

## v2.0.0 — 2026-05-22

### Breaking changes

- **Removed** `md2html` and `md2pdf` binaries. Use `md2doc` instead.
  - `md2html foo.md` → `md2doc foo.md`
  - `md2pdf foo.md`  → `md2doc --pdf foo.md`
- **Removed** default output next to the source markdown.
  - Default output now writes to `<os-tmpdir>/md2doc/<stem>-<hash>.<format>`.
  - Pass `--out <path>` to write somewhere specific.
- **Changed** `--open` to default ON when `--out` is absent.
  - Pass `--no-open` to opt out.
  - Passing `--out` automatically disables auto-open (override with `--open`).

### Added

- Unified `md2doc` CLI with `--html` / `--pdf` flag selection.
- Both formats in one invocation: `md2doc --html --pdf foo.md`.
- `--out` directory mode (`--out ./build/`) for batch output with stable filenames.
- `--no-open` flag for explicit opt-out of viewer launch.
- `test/cli.test.js` covering the full CLI surface.

### Internal

- `lib/md2doc.js` rendering pipeline unchanged. The new binary is a thin
  orchestrator: arg parse → output path resolution → spawn `lib/md2doc.js` per
  `(input, format)` → optional viewer launch.
